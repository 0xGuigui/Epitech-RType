## How does it work

When a client want to contact the server, he must first connect using a tcp socket.
This allows the server to know the client's ip and port and know specifically which client is sending a request.
The client can then use multiple commands (listed bellow) to create and manage games.
After the game start, all game clients are notified with a port to connect on using udp.
They then has access to different commands to play the game (send actions, inputs and read game state).

## Making requests

### Resume

To make request, the client must use the sf::Packet provided by the sfml library.
The packet is a stream of bytes that can be read and written.
Client must then input the command type using the TcpRequest enum.

```c++
sf::Packet packet;

packet << REQ_CREATE_GAME;
// set the game name
packet << "My game";
// send the packet
socket.send(packet);
```

Then, server will response using the TcpResponse enum.
```c++
socket.receive(packet);

TcpResponse response;
packet >> response;

if (response == RES_OK) {
    // do something
}
```
